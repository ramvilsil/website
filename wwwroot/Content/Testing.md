# Sample Markdown File

This is a sample markdown file that showcases the basic syntax and features of Markdown.

## Headings

You can create headings using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the heading, with one `#` indicating the highest level.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Text Formatting

You can format text in a variety of ways using Markdown syntax:

- *Italic*: Use `*` or `_` to surround the text you want to italicize.
- **Bold**: Use `**` or `__` to surround the text you want to bold.
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Use `~~` to strike through text.

## Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists using Markdown syntax:

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Links

You can add links to your Markdown files using the following syntax:

- Inline links: `[Link text](URL)`
- Reference links: `[Link text][reference]` and `[reference]: URL`

For example, here's a link to [Google](https://www.google.com).

## Images

You can add images to your Markdown files using the following syntax:

- Inline images: `![Alt text](image URL)`
- Reference images: `![Alt text][reference]` and `[reference]: image URL`

For example, here's a cute cat picture:

![Cute cat](https://i.imgur.com/PItTJbW.jpg)

## Code

You can include code snippets in your Markdown files using the following syntax:

- Inline code: Use backticks (`) to surround the code.
- Code blocks: Use triple backticks (```) to surround the code, and add the language after the first set of backticks.

For example, here's some inline code: `print("Hello, world!")`

And here's a code block:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
    
greet("Alice")
